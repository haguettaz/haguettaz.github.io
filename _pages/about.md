I am a PhD student in the Laboratory of Signal and Information Processing with Prof. Hans-Andrea Loeliger, where my primary research focuses on neural computation.
My work delves into the mechanisms of information processing in neural systems, exploring how these processes can be modeled and understood through computational methods. 
Beyond neural computation, I have a strong interest in convex optimization and applied probability theory, which I like to incorporate into my research.
