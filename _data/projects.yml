    - title: Nonograms and Iterative Constraints Propagation
      student: Alessio Lukaj
      semester: Fall
      year: 2022
      abstract: Nonograms are constraint-satisfaction picture puzzles in which one tries to paint the pixels of a given grid to reveal a hidden picture, while satisfying all its row and column constraints. It has been shown that the problem of solving a nonogram is NP-complete. In this project, we investigate how to algorithmically solve multi-colored nonograms using factor graphs and iterative constraints propagation with low complexity. In addition, we present certain techniques that can be employed to solve nonograms with multiple solutions.
